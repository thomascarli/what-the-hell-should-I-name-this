# WHAT THE HELL SHOULD I NAME THIS

Naming shit is hard. WTHSINT is a simple open source name generator to help you find the perfect name for your variables, methods, services and everything else in between.
For the MVP, this will essentially be a thesaurus.  Eventually, I would love this to be a stupid website where you can find dumb names for all your shit!
